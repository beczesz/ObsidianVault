## Ideas for Dashborad
- Monitor paid leave as well separately, so that we can see how the income is affected when people are on vacation
- Internal project like SonrisaSys should give shared bench
- 24 / 7 support should be separate
	- We need a new category called 24_7 support: calculate the planned and actial in separate colum
	- There is not just income but a cost associated with it, we need to show this somehow
		- Maybe a costs tab in general?
