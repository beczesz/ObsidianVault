# Notes

### Hierarchies vs. Networks

- **Hierarchy:** Top-down structure (e.g., folders, org charts).
- **Network:** Bottom-up, flexible structure (e.g., tag-based connections).
- Both structures coexist and complement each other—networks flourish within hierarchies and vice versa [Forte Labs+1](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-tagging-for-personal-knowledge-management/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-tagging-for-personal-knowledge-management/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Tags help bridge these structures by adding network-like flexibility to organized systems.


### Best practices

1. Don't tag the ***content*** but the ***context***
	Tag the project in which the note is useful instead of what it contains.
2. Keep it simple and not more then 10-15 tags.
3. Organically and incrementally tag. You don't have to tag upfront.


### Categoriazation
#### 1. **Status / Stage Tags**

These show _where something is in its lifecycle_.

- Examples:
    
    - `#draft` → a note you’re still roughing out
    - `#review` → something you want to check before using       
    - `#final` → a finished deliverable (e.g. published blog post)        
    - `#idea` → raw brainstorm that hasn’t been acted on yet        

---

#### 2. **Type / Format Tags**

These describe _what kind of thing it is_.

- Examples:
    
    - `#quote` → a passage from a book        
    - `#diagram` → a sketch or figure        
    - `#template` → reusable structure (e.g. meeting agenda)        
    - `#checklist` → step-by-step procedure        

---

#### 3. **Topic / Subject Tags**

These cut across projects and areas, grouping by _what it’s about_.

- Examples:
    
    - `#leadership` → useful whether it’s a book note, a podcast, or an email draft        
    - `#cloud-architecture`        
    - `#parenting`        
    - `#creativity`
