### PARA in a Nutshell

- **Projects** → short-term, with a clear goal & deadline.
- **Areas** → long-term responsibilities you want to maintain.
- **Resources** → reference materials, “maybe useful later.”
- **Archives** → inactive stuff, safely stored but out of sight.


### 🚀 How to Use It

1. **Folder structure**: Create these 4 top-level folders in Obsidian or Google Drive: `Projects / Areas / Resources / Archives`.
2. **Limit Projects**: Try to keep Projects < 10 at once. When finished, move them to Archives.    
3. **Areas as compass**: Use Areas to remind yourself what really matters long-term (like family, leadership, health).    
4. **Resources as fuel**: Whenever you save an article, drop it into Resources. Only process it further if linked to a Project.    
5. **Archives for peace of mind**: Don’t delete — just move out of sight.
