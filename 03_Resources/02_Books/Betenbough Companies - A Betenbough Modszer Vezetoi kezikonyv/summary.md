# A Betenbough Módszer Vezetői kézikönyv – Summary

## Abstract and thesis

This Hungarian edition of the **Betenbough Method Leader’s Guide** outlines how the management team of the Texas‑based Betenbough Companies integrates Christian faith into every aspect of leadership and corporate culture.  The book opens with personal prefaces from the translator and a bishop who highlight how the authors – members of Betenbough’s leadership – see God as an active participant in everyday work and relationships【58413048419867†L123-L130】.  They stress that love for people and a passion for God’s purposes are essential to effective leadership【58413048419867†L123-L146】.  Subsequent sections present the “Betenbough Way,” a corporate covenant and a theology of work that roots business practices in biblical teachings.  The authors describe the responsibilities of spiritual leadership, discernment of spirits, hiring practices, feedback, team accountability, communication and decision‑making.  Throughout, they advocate humility, honesty, mercy and empowerment while warning against complacency, comfort and authoritarianism.  

**Thesis:** Authentic leadership grounded in Christian faith and servant‑hearted love transforms organisational culture and promotes sustainable excellence.

## Chapter notes (question & answer format)

| **Question** | **Answer (summary)** |
| --- | --- |
| **What is the Betenbough Way?** | The Betenbough Way recounts how a home‑building company in Texas adopted a kingdom‑oriented business model.  The authors explain that God is not an abstract concept but an active partner in their work and relationships; this perspective shapes their mission and drives a people‑centred culture【58413048419867†L123-L130】. |
| **What do they believe?** | The book details foundational beliefs rooted in the Bible.  Leaders commit to a covenant that emphasises submission to God’s authority, honouring employees and customers, stewarding resources and sharing profits generously. |
| **How is work viewed theologically?** | A chapter on the theology of work asserts that all labour has intrinsic value because God works and calls humans to co‑operate with Him.  Work becomes a form of worship when done with excellence, integrity and service. |
| **What defines spiritual leadership?** | Spiritual leadership requires abiding in God’s presence through prayer and scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit and modelling humility and repentance.  Leaders are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with God and to lead by example rather than coercion. |
| **What is the Betenbough Leadership Covenant?** | All leaders pledge to cultivate character, relationships and competence.  Commitments include practicing vulnerability, giving and receiving truth‑filled feedback, empowering others, protecting unity and serving as stewards rather than owners of the organisation. |
| **How should leaders discern spirits?** | Leaders are taught to differentiate between wise, foolish and wicked behaviours.  Wisdom is marked by teachability and accountability; folly resists feedback but may change with patience; wickedness is characterised by malice and must be confronted or removed for the sake of the team. |
| **How does the book address corporate culture?** | The authors argue that corporate culture must align with kingdom values rather than merely mimic generic Christian identity.  They emphasise building a culture of transparency, grace and justice where decisions are guided by purpose rather than profit alone. |
| **What are the core leadership values?** | Core values include love, humility, integrity, generosity, gratitude, courage and truth.  Leaders are challenged to prioritise people over tasks, pursue continuous growth and make decisions that honour God and serve others. |
| **How is feedback approached?** | Feedback is portrayed as “hunger for truth.”  Leaders and team members are expected to invite and deliver honest feedback with kindness, recognising that truth spoken in love fosters growth and prevents resentment. |
| **What does long‑term leadership involve?** | Long‑term leadership focuses on legacy rather than short‑term results.  Leaders invest in developing successors, sharpen their skills (“sharpen the axe”), build trust through consistent communication and accept that growth often requires patience and pruning. |
| **What is the coaching spectrum?** | Coaching ranges from directive instruction to open‑ended questioning.  Leaders are encouraged to move towards asking powerful questions that help others discover solutions rather than simply telling them what to do. |
| **Why is courage emphasised over comfort?** | The book warns that seeking comfort leads to complacency, while courage fosters innovation and faithfulness.  Leaders must embrace discomfort to confront issues, challenge assumptions and speak truth with love. |
| **How should big decisions be made?** | Significant decisions should not be taken alone; the authors advocate seeking counsel, praying together and discerning God’s direction collectively to avoid individual biases. |
| **How does the guide address team building and communication?** | A healthy team is considered a leader’s primary responsibility.  The authors provide practical advice on hiring mission‑aligned people, empowering them, holding them accountable and maintaining clear, multi‑level communication.  They emphasise listening first, celebrating wins and openly explaining the “why” behind decisions. |
| **What is the overall message?** | The Betenbough Method blends spiritual formation with practical leadership skills.  It calls leaders to use their influence to serve others, pursue God’s kingdom in the marketplace and create workplaces where people can thrive spiritually, relationally and professionally. |
