# Future of Jobs Report 2025 (World Economic Forum, 2025)

## Abstract (<300 words)
The World Economic Forum’s *Future of Jobs Report 2025* synthesizes insights from over 1,000 employers across 14.1 million workers, 22 industry clusters and 55 economies【377571214104098†L580-L604】.  The report identifies five macrotrends reshaping labour markets—technological change, the green transition, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty and demographic shifts【377571214104098†L588-L604】.  Surveyed employers believe digital access, AI and big data, robotics and energy technologies will be the most transformative forces; 60% expect broadening digital access to drive business change, while 86% anticipate AI and information‑processing technologies to be transformative by 2030【377571214104098†L673-L679】【377571214104098†L695-L706】.

Employers predict that structural labour‑market transformation between 2025 and 2030 will create 170 million jobs (14% of today’s employment) and displace 92 million jobs (8%), resulting in net growth of 78 million jobs【377571214104098†L330-L339】.  Frontline roles such as farmworkers, delivery drivers, construction workers and food‑processing workers are expected to see the largest absolute growth【377571214104098†L347-L355】, while technology‑related positions (Big Data specialists, AI and machine‑learning engineers, software developers, renewable‑energy engineers) will experience the fastest percentage growth【377571214104098†L359-L367】.  Conversely, clerical and secretarial roles—including cashiers, ticket clerks and administrative assistants—are projected to decline【377571214104098†L369-L375】.

The survey suggests that 39% of workers’ current skills will be transformed by 2030【377571214104098†L376-L381】.  Analytical thinking, resilience, flexibility, leadership and social influence top the list of in‑demand skills【377571214104098†L388-L393】, while AI, big data and cybersecurity skills are the fastest‑growing technical competencies【377571214104098†L395-L403】.  Employers expect significant upskilling: if the world’s workforce were 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030; 29 could be reskilled in their current roles, 19 redeployed elsewhere and 11 risk missing out on necessary training【377571214104098†L417-L425】.  Skill gaps are the primary barrier to transformation—63% of employers identify them as a major challenge【377571214104098†L426-L429】.  In response, 85% plan to prioritize upskilling, 70% intend to hire talent with new skills and 40% expect to reduce staff where skills become obsolete【377571214104098†L431-L434】.

Finally, the report highlights that workforce strategies go beyond skills.  Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have gained momentum: 83% of employers now have such programmes, up from 67% in 2023【377571214104098†L447-L454】.  Employers also foresee a shift in wages—over half plan to allocate a greater share of revenue to pay by 2030【377571214104098†L459-L463】—and recognise that supporting employee well‑being and offering flexible work options will improve talent availability【377571214104098†L436-L444】.  The report presents a nuanced picture of a labour market where technological innovation and social priorities converge, urging policymakers and businesses to balance automation with investment in human capital.

**1‑line thesis:** *Future of Jobs Report 2025* argues that the next five years will see significant but manageable labour‑market upheaval: technological and green‑transition trends will create more jobs than they destroy, but realizing this potential depends on massive reskilling efforts and policies that prioritize worker well‑being and inclusivity【377571214104098†L330-L339】【377571214104098†L417-L434】.

## Context
- **Author/institution:** The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a Swiss non‑profit organisation founded in 1971 that engages business, political and civil society leaders to shape global agendas. Its *Future of Jobs* reports, published biennially since 2016, survey employers to forecast labour‑market trends.
- **Historical context:** Released in January 2025 amid economic stabilization post‑COVID‑19 and rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies, the report responds to rising automation, climate‑change commitments and geopolitical fragmentation【377571214104098†L588-L604】【377571214104098†L716-L777】.  With global unemployment at 4.9%—its lowest level since 1991—and inflation easing to 3.5%, the report assesses how structural changes will interact with demographic and socio‑economic disparities【377571214104098†L486-L506】.
- **Genre & tradition:** Insight report / labour‑market forecast. It builds on previous *Future of Jobs* editions but places greater emphasis on AI, the green transition and reskilling strategies.
- **Contrarian signal:** While automation is often seen as a job killer, the report predicts net job growth, contending that technology will create more roles than it eliminates【377571214104098†L330-L339】.  It also highlights that success hinges on human‑centric strategies, challenging narratives that emphasize technology alone.
- **Reception & influence:** The report informs policy makers, corporations and educational institutions worldwide. Media coverage has highlighted its optimistic job‑creation outlook and urgent call for large‑scale reskilling programmes. It is likely to influence government labour policies and corporate training investments.
- **Comparable works:** International Labour Organization’s *World Employment and Social Outlook*; McKinsey’s *The Future of Work in America*; previous WEF *Future of Jobs* reports (2018, 2020, 2023).
- **Who should read:** Policy makers, corporate strategists, educators, workforce‑development professionals, economists and anyone interested in the intersection of technology, sustainability and labour markets.

### Introduction: The global labour‑market landscape in 2025
| Guiding question | Answer (2–4 sentences) | Evidence/examples | Skeptical challenge | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What is the economic and labour‑market backdrop for the report? | The report opens by noting that the global economy has stabilized after the COVID‑19 disruptions: growth is projected at 3.2% for 2025 and inflation at 3.5%【377571214104098†L486-L497】.  Unemployment stands at 4.9%, the lowest since 1991, but disparities remain—youth unemployment persists at 13% and female unemployment exceeds male unemployment in many lower‑income economies【377571214104098†L501-L533】. | The report cites International Labour Organization data on unemployment rates and notes that low‑income economies saw an increase in unemployment from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2024【377571214104098†L501-L507】. | Does a low global unemployment rate mask hidden underemployment? The report acknowledges that underemployment and the jobs gap remain challenges, with low‑income economies experiencing a rise in job deficits【377571214104098†L535-L549】. | Policy makers should target youth and female employment, expand social protection and consider training programmes for underemployed workers. |

### Drivers of labour‑market transformation
| Guiding question | Answer (2–4 sentences) | Evidence/examples | Skeptical challenge | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Which macrotrends are reshaping jobs? | Employers identify five major forces: technological change, the green transition, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty and demographic shifts【377571214104098†L588-L604】.  Within these, broadening digital access is cited by 60% of employers as the top driver of business transformation, while AI and information‑processing technologies are viewed as the most impactful technological trend (86% of respondents)【377571214104098†L673-L679】【377571214104098†L695-L706】. | The report lists additional trends including rising costs of living, investments to reduce carbon emissions, climate‑change adaptation, ageing populations and increased geopolitical divisions【377571214104098†L641-L668】. | Could these macrotrends be overestimated? Employers may underestimate unpredictable shocks (e.g., pandemics) or under‑report regional nuances. The report notes that responses vary by region and industry【377571214104098†L780-L807】. | Businesses should scan the macrotrends relevant to their sector and assess how digital access, AI and sustainability commitments will reshape their workforce needs. |

### Jobs outlook
| Guiding question | Answer (2–4 sentences) | Evidence/examples | Skeptical challenge | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What is the expected net impact of labour‑market transformation on jobs? | Employers foresee that by 2030 structural transformation will affect 22% of current jobs, creating 170 million new roles and displacing 92 million existing roles【377571214104098†L330-L339】.  This equates to net growth of 78 million jobs, or 7% of current employment【377571214104098†L330-L339】. | Frontline roles—farmworkers, delivery drivers, construction workers, salespeople and food‑processing workers—are predicted to see the largest absolute increase【377571214104098†L347-L355】. | Will automation and AI eventually outpace job creation? The report stresses that the job outlook hinges on policy, investment and training; without proactive strategies, displacement could outpace creation. | Governments should invest in infrastructure and training to support job creation in sectors boosted by technology and sustainability initiatives. |
| Which roles will grow or decline fastest? | Technology‑related jobs such as Big Data specialists, fintech engineers, AI and machine‑learning specialists and software developers are set to grow the fastest in percentage terms【377571214104098†L359-L367】.  Green‑economy roles—autonomous and electric‑vehicle specialists, environmental engineers and renewable‑energy engineers—also appear among the top growth roles【377571214104098†L359-L367】.  Clerical and secretarial positions (cashiers, ticket clerks, administrative assistants, postal clerks, bank tellers and data‑entry clerks) are expected to decline rapidly【377571214104098†L369-L375】. | The report notes that many frontline jobs will be supported by technology rather than replaced by it; for example, delivery drivers may operate alongside autonomous systems. | Will technology growth primarily benefit high‑skill workers? The growth of green and tech roles may widen wage gaps unless accompanied by accessible training. Companies should broaden recruitment to non‑traditional talent pools. |

### Skills outlook
| Guiding question | Answer (2–4 sentences) | Evidence/examples | Skeptical challenge | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| How will skills requirements change? | By 2030, 39% of workers’ current skills will be disrupted【377571214104098†L376-L381】.  Analytical thinking is the most sought‑after core skill, followed by resilience, flexibility and agility, and leadership/social influence【377571214104098†L388-L393】.  In terms of technical skills, AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity and technology literacy will see the fastest growth【377571214104098†L395-L403】, while manual dexterity and precision skills will decline【377571214104098†L399-L405】. | The report finds that creative thinking, curiosity and lifelong learning will continue to rise in importance【377571214104098†L399-L401】. | Does the pace of skill disruption differ by industry? Yes—industries adopting automation faster (e.g., IT, finance) will experience more rapid skill turnover, while others may lag. | Educators and employers should align curricula and training programmes with emerging skills, especially in analytics, AI, cybersecurity and soft skills. |
| What strategies are proposed to close skill gaps? | The report states that 59% of the global workforce will require training by 2030; employers foresee that 29% can be reskilled within their current roles and 19% redeployed, leaving 11% without adequate training【377571214104098†L417-L425】.  Skill gaps are the biggest barrier to business transformation—63% of employers cite them as a major challenge—and 85% plan to prioritize upskilling【377571214104098†L426-L434】. | Employers plan to hire new workers with needed skills (70%), transition staff from declining to growing roles (50%) and reduce staff when skills become obsolete (40%)【377571214104098†L431-L435】. | Could employees resist reskilling due to cost or time? The report suggests that effective policies (funding, incentives and flexible learning) and supportive workplace cultures are needed to encourage training【377571214104098†L440-L445】. | Governments and companies should develop accessible training programmes, provide financial support and emphasise employee well‑being to secure participation in reskilling initiatives. |

### Workforce strategies
| Guiding question | Answer (2–4 sentences) | Evidence/examples | Skeptical challenge | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Beyond skills, how are employers planning to attract and retain talent? | Employers emphasise supporting employee health and well‑being (64% cite it as a key strategy), improving talent progression and promotion, and funding reskilling【377571214104098†L436-L444】.  Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are increasingly widespread—83% of employers report having them, up from 67% in 2023【377571214104098†L447-L454】.  Over half of employers plan to allocate a greater share of revenue to wages by 2030【377571214104098†L459-L463】. | The report notes that employers expect public policies around reskilling, education improvements and flexible hiring practices to boost talent availability【377571214104098†L440-L445】. | Will DEI and well‑being measures survive economic downturns? Some employers may deprioritize them when budgets tighten; the report argues that inclusive practices are essential for broadening talent pools and building resilience【377571214104098†L447-L457】. | Companies should institutionalize DEI and well‑being into strategy, implement transparent promotion pathways and collaborate with governments on reskilling funding. |

## Key Ideas
1. **Macrotrends are multi‑faceted and interconnected** – The report frames the future of work around five macrotrends—technological change, the green transition, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty and demographic shifts【377571214104098†L588-L604】.  Broader digital access is viewed as the single most transformative trend (60% of employers), while AI and information‑processing technologies top the list of specific technologies expected to reshape businesses (86% of employers)【377571214104098†L673-L679】【377571214104098†L695-L706】.
2. **Job creation outweighs job destruction—but only with strategic intervention** – Employers project net growth of 78 million jobs by 2030 (170 million created vs. 92 million displaced)【377571214104098†L330-L339】.  Growth will be concentrated in frontline and technology‑driven roles【377571214104098†L347-L367】, while clerical and secretarial jobs will decline【377571214104098†L369-L375】.  Without policies that support transition, displaced workers could face long‑term unemployment.
3. **Skill disruption is pervasive and demands lifelong learning** – About 39% of workers’ skills will be disrupted by 2030【377571214104098†L376-L381】.  Analytical thinking and resilience are top core skills【377571214104098†L388-L393】, while AI, big data and cybersecurity are the fastest‑growing technical skills【377571214104098†L395-L403】.  Manual dexterity and precision tasks will decline【377571214104098†L399-L405】.
4. **Massive reskilling and upskilling programmes are essential** – Employers estimate that 59% of the workforce will require training; 29% of workers can be reskilled in their current roles, 19% redeployed and 11% risk missing out【377571214104098†L417-L425】.  Skill gaps are the primary barrier to transformation—63% of employers cite them—so 85% plan to prioritize upskilling【377571214104098†L426-L434】.
5. **Holistic workforce strategies matter** – Beyond training, employers prioritise employee well‑being, career progression and DEI initiatives.  The share of employers with DEI programmes has risen to 83%【377571214104098†L447-L454】, and 64% see health and well‑being as a top attraction strategy【377571214104098†L436-L439】.  More than half plan to increase wage share by 2030【377571214104098†L459-L463】.
