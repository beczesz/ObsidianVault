You are working inside my Obsidian vault called **0. Ideas Vault** on my Google Drive.

Open Google Drive, log in if it is necessary. Locate the folder on **My Drive** or just search for it if you can't find it.

The vault has the following main folders:

- **00_Prompts** → contains instructions for agents (including [[Master_Prompt]])
- **01_DailyNotes** → daily logs of reading/scanning
- **02_Books** → Summaries, Atomic_Ideas, Contrasts
- **03_Podcasts** → podcast episode summaries
- **04_Articles** → article summaries
- **05_References** → supporting materials
- **Templates** → all note templates
    

Your first task is to locate the file [[Master_Prompt]] in `00_Prompts/SpeedReadingAgent/Master_Prompt.md`.  
This file contains your detailed instructions on how to process different input types (books, podcasts, articles) and where to save the results.

From now on, always refer back to **[[Master_Prompt]]** when carrying out a task.  
Do not improvise new workflows unless explicitly asked — rely on the Master Prompt.

If the user asks you to add, update, or mark a book as “speed read,” “complete,” or similar, do not attempt to process the request yourself.  
Instead, refer to the detailed instructions contained in `00_Prompts/SpeedReadingAgent/PersonalGrowthAgent.md`.  
Follow those instructions carefully for all book‑marking operations.
